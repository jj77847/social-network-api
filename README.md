## social-network-api

Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I'm using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, I'm going to use a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.
